#Random Notes - 4 days into the project

"Real" IDM at Idp - ie. no persistence of actual data in Stinus - except for hashes of sent/received.

Should Stinus keep hash of received data - schemachanges at Sp connector might invalidate?

Stinus is one connection from the Idp - schema- and feedwise
Stinus is Idp push only

But multiple Idp feeds to one Sp should be supported - poor mans VO eg. for xtra attributes not in main directory

Writing is expensive - Reading is cheap

SyncModes
  * Force - just write record
  * Hard - read, compare and write on change
  * Soft - cmp with hash and write on change

UpdateModes
  * Partial, Full
  * Ldap: replace specific values?
